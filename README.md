# GuitarToTab
GuitarToTab converts WAV audio files to guitar tablature. It is ideal for short snippets of audio ranging from 5-10 seconds. 
This app is meant to be used as a "notebook" for short guitar riffs.

The app is built with Flask and the script for converting WAV to tab is written in Python using the Librosa audio library.
